I am a molecular biologist by training with a masters in molecular science from Ryerson University. My supervisor was [Dr. Roberto Botelho](http://botelholab.com/). My thesis focused on characterizing the protein TgPH1 as an ectopic reporter for endosomal phosphoinositides with the paper being published in the journal [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198454). Please see my CV for more details.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in contributing to discovery research, towards drug discovery and development of novel therapeutics.

I am also interested in programming, hobby electronics, art/design and CAD and I hope to have those projects for you to see in the future.
