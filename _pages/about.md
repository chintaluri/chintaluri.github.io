Currently, I am a research associate at a company called [Xtal Biostructures Inc.](http://xtalbiostructures.com/) I have worked in protein production and now mainly work in biophysical characterization of proteins utilizing [TSA(DSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_shift_assay) and [SPR](https://www.gelifesciences.com/en/us/solutions/protein-research/knowledge-center/surface-plasmon-resonance/surface-plasmon-resonance). Applications of these methods help to characterize ligand binding kinetics, identifying promising molecules from compound screens, determining protein stability in various buffer conditions and measuring the melting temperature of the protein to name a few. 

Formerly, I worked mainly in the field of cell biology and molecular biology with with a masters in molecular science from Ryerson University. My supervisor was [Dr. Roberto Botelho](http://botelholab.com/). My thesis focused on characterizing the protein TgPH1 as an ectopic reporter for endosomal phosphoinositides with the paper being published in the journal [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198454). Please see my CV for more details.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in contributing to discovery research, towards drug discovery and development of novel therapeutics.

I am also interested in programming, hobby electronics, art/design and CAD and I hope to have those projects for you to see in the future.
