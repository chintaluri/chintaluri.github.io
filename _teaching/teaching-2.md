I was a teaching assistant for this course. My responsibilities included instructing students on theory and instrument use and supervising students during the lab. This lab course dealt with experiments on recombinant DNA technology. Experiments included DNA isolation, cloning, and RE digestion, PCR, protein isolation and  characterization, SDS-PAGE, and western blotting.
