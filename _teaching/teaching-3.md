I was a teaching assistant for this course. My responsibilities included instructing students on theory and instrument use and supervising 
students during the lab. This course deals with the structure, function and chemistry of the molecular building blocks of the cell. The laboratory provides an introduction to the basic biochemical techniques including chromatography, electrophoresis and spectrophotometry.
