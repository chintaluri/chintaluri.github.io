I was a teaching assistant for this course. My responsibilities included instructing students on theory and instrument use and supervising students during the lab. I also graded assignments, lab reports and presentations.This course dealt with structures, functions, chemistry and food applications of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids. The laboratory provides introduction to basic techniques used in analytical biochemistry.
